# Autonomous-Parking-Project
This project is my final degree project, as part of my M.Eng Mechatronics Engineering degree at the University of Glasgow.
This project aims to build an autonomous solution for parking vehicles in parallel parking space, using an optimal trajectory.

##Running Instructions
To run the application, make sure all the files are in the same folder. main_mpc.m is the final version of the main application. Ensure that all necessary MATLAB toolboxes are installed. MATLAB should let you know which toolboxes are missing when you try to run it for the first time.
